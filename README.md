# Thumbnail-Creator-Python
A python version of my other thumbnail creator. Users input a directory, the system checks the directory if it's real and then it will create a new directory called thumbnail in this directory and store resized images in there. If an existing thumbnail directory exists in that location it will delete it before starting the image resizing.
